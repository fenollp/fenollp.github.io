## Let's craft Solar Sails (cheaply & at home)

Bill of materials:
* nylon thread (= fishing line)
* aluminized PET sheet (= emergency Mylar thermal blanket)
* Low Earth Orbit (LEO) - like (~200Â°C) heat source (= heat gun)
* ???

The final step is to find a way to combine the above 2 ingredients
such that a structure can unfold once in LEO
and take a "flat enough" shape to reflect Sun rays.

Note that, to be able to survive Space conditions:
* overall weight must be minimized and then so should initial volume (deployed within a Space launcher)
* structure must not outgas: materials should not sublimate nor exert gas (attitude would change, lifespan would shorten)
* LEO insolation temperatures can be utilized as deployment energy

This challenge is offered to College & High School students to devise a way to fit the largest & lighest (& mightiest) Solar Sail
they can in the cheapest Cubesat possible, aiming below 100g/m2 (all hardware included).

### My take
* tumbleweed-like structure + insolated Nylon muscles to open up parabolic surface
	* light but solid "articulations" keep the shape in extension, once Nylon muscles extend it
* *auxetic dome*
	* Nylon muscles pull on the many centroids such that the plane expends into a dome that then stays as such
