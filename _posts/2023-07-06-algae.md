kelp to ammonia

extract ammonia from kelp

		> In order to appropriately value the nutrient mitigation services provided by seaweed cultivation, appropriate methodologies are needed for accurate, low‐cost nitrogen monitoring within the context of seaweed farming systems to quantify the amount of nitrogen present and assimilated by seaweed cultivation. ARPA‐E seeks solutions that will add value to the MARINER program and provide technology‐to‐market (T2M) opportunities for large scale seaweed cultivation.

	>. While these compounds may be metabolized by aquatic organisms, the over-abundance of these
758 nutrients leads to eutrophication, making ammonia and ammonium toxic to aquatic life (Howrath 2008,
759 Spiertz 2009, Fowler et al. 2013).

	> Growing large amounts of macroalgae would not compete with land-based food crops, requires no fresh water and can be grown without the addition of energy-intensive, synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. Large-scale macroalgae cultivation may help reduce the negative effects of nutrient overload of many coastal ocean regions.

905 The atmospheric deposition of ammonia (dry) and ammonium (wet) to terrestrial and marine
906 environments was discussed in Evaluation Question 4 and would also result in soil and water
907 contamination (Aneja et al. 2008, Howrath 2008, Spiertz 2009, Fowler et al. 2013). The movement of excess
908 nutrients from soils and the atmospheres into marine environments results in eutrophication (Aneja et al.
909 2008, Erisman et al. 2008, Howrath 2008, Spiertz 2009, Fowler et al. 2013, Bindraban et al. 2014). In this
910 process, the abundance of nutrients drives algal blooms and reduce oxygen concentrations (Aneja et al.
911 2008, Erisman et al. 2008, Howrath 2008). As a result, the influx of ammonia and ammonium compounds
912 into marine environments is toxic to aquatic life ranging from microorganisms to fish (Aneja et al. 2008,
913 Spiertz 2009).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication
Eutrophication is the process by which an entire body of water, or parts of it, becomes progressively enriched with minerals and nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus.
[..]
In coastal waters on the other hand, the main contributing nutrient is more likely to be nitrogen, or nitrogen and phosphorus together. This depends on the location and other factors.
