		* > In order to appropriately value the nutrient mitigation services provided by seaweed cultivation, appropriate methodologies are needed for accurate, low‐cost nitrogen monitoring within the context of seaweed farming systems to quantify the amount of nitrogen present and assimilated by seaweed cultivation. ARPA‐E seeks solutions that will add value to the MARINER program and provide technology‐to‐market (T2M) opportunities for large scale seaweed cultivation.

	* > While these compounds may be metabolized by aquatic organisms, the over-abundance of these nutrients leads to eutrophication, making ammonia and ammonium toxic to aquatic life (Howrath 2008, Spiertz 2009, Fowler et al. 2013).

	* > Growing large amounts of macroalgae would not compete with land-based food crops, requires no fresh water and can be grown without the addition of energy-intensive, synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. Large-scale macroalgae cultivation may help reduce the negative effects of nutrient overload of many coastal ocean regions.

	* > The atmospheric deposition of ammonia (dry) and ammonium (wet) to terrestrial and marine
      	environments was discussed in Evaluation Question 4 and would also result in soil and water
      	contamination (Aneja et al. 2008, Howrath 2008, Spiertz 2009, Fowler et al. 2013). The movement of excess
      	nutrients from soils and the atmospheres into marine environments results in eutrophication (Aneja et al.
      	2008, Erisman et al. 2008, Howrath 2008, Spiertz 2009, Fowler et al. 2013, Bindraban et al. 2014). In this
      	process, the abundance of nutrients drives algal blooms and reduce oxygen concentrations (Aneja et al.
      	2008, Erisman et al. 2008, Howrath 2008). As a result, the influx of ammonia and ammonium compounds
      	into marine environments is toxic to aquatic life ranging from microorganisms to fish (Aneja et al. 2008,
      	Spiertz 2009).

	* > Eutrophication is the process by which an entire body of water, or parts of it, becomes progressively enriched with minerals and nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus.

	* > In coastal waters on the other hand, the main contributing nutrient is more likely to be nitrogen, or nitrogen and phosphorus together. This depends on the location and other factors.

	* > The soil should be fertile enough to give high production and plants require critical nutrients from fertile soil
		which also supports a diversified and dynamic biotic population that helps the soil resist environmental degradation.
		Bio fertilization is a sustainable agricultural practice that includes using bio-fertilizer to upsurge the nutrient content
		of the soil and organic matters, resulting in higher productivity. Micro and Macro algae are correct environmentally friendly
		bio-based fertilizers for pollution-free agricultural applies. Microalgae are more effective bio-fertilizers to soil than macroalga,
		but macro alga gives the best results in mega scaled aquatic media in addition to the availability for the reproduction of huge bulk
		from microalga rapidly in the laboratory. Microalga recorded the utmost levels of soil fertility with clay soil than a sandy one.
		Both micro and macro alga can be used for heavy metal removal similarly.
