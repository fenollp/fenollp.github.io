* mining is the number one polluting industry on the planet, yet provides for all our metals / many chemicals
* **water desalination** ... produces copious amounts of toxic **brine**

[2016, Mining valuable minerals from seawater: a critical review](https://doi.org/10.1039/C6EW00268D)

> For example, it was estimated that the market value
> of Na, Ca, Mg, and K, if they are successfully extracted from the rejected brine of `a`
> desalination plant in Saudi Arabia, would be approximately `$US18 billion per year`.


[2022, Seawater desalination concentrate—a new frontier for sustainable mining of valuable minerals](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41545-022-00153-6)

> it is likely that commercial development of the non-NaCl components of desalination brine will depend on the available market for NaCl,
> as the challenges and costs of extracting the other mineral components from bitterns in which they are highly enriched are so much less
> than those faced in direct treatment of brines.


> Extraction of mineral products from desalination plant concentrate has potential advantages compared to terrestrial mining of the same compounds.
> These include: the essentially inexhaustible scale of the ocean; the constant composition of the ocean;
> the vast capacity of the ocean to dilute treated waste streams; and the stable and fixed footprint of the mining operation.

Turbulence is crucial for mixing heat and nutrients throughout the ocean. Previous research largely shows that the turbulence animals cause living their lives isn’t enough to substantially mix the layers of the ocean’s water column. But Castro’s study—which was published in 2022 and won a 2023 Ig Nobel Prize for humorous, thought-provoking scientific achievement—shows that within ocean layers, anchovy spawning causes significant, if subtle, swings in temperature. This finding suggests that in shallower water, the ruckus produced by plentiful piscine participants procreating all at once might be more powerful and more important for ocean mixing than previously thought.
