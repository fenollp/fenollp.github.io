```
mycelium can be grown to match shapes in a couple weeks (slow)
	constraint = injection molded transparent plastic molds
[Is Mycelium Fungus the Plastic of the Future?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cApVVuuqLFY)
	get timestamp of "casting"
but it can be better .mkv
	cut mycelium and you get clones of the same entity
		that can merge again
			so grow one guy
				cut smol slices separately
					reassemble pieces as needed and cast
						fills all of the mold space and re-merges (probably a cubic law in there)
							i.e. grows faster
```
