* `mycelium can be grown to match shapes in a couple weeks (slow)`
	* `constraint = injection molded transparent plastic molds`
* [Is Mycelium Fungus the Plastic of the Future?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cApVVuuqLFY)
	* `get timestamp of "casting"`
* `but it can be better .mkv`
	* `cut mycelium and you get clones of the same entity`
		* `that can merge again`
			* `so grow one guy`
				* `cut smol slices separately`
					* `reassemble pieces as needed and cast`
						* `fills all of the mold space and re-merges (probably a cubic law in there)`
							* `i.e. grows faster`
