Hi! 
I am an amateur with an interest in a specific material: quartz, or more precisely rounded quartz grain or sand with particle size ranging 15-53Î¼m.

I understand the SP3D technique relies on kinetic energy to print the part. Could you share your experience with using e.g. desert sand as a printing material?

Thanks!
